# The Djhavian Language
Djhavi is a relatively complex glyphic language that I have recently began to uncover.

At current (07.06.24), the language is only partially understood, with only three tenses that I have learnt -- preterite (I did), present (I do), and pure future (I will do) -- and a limited vocabulary, however I am actively learning more about its inner workings.

In the future, I am aiming for this repository to feature:
- a dictionary containing every known noun, adjective, infinitive verb, etc. that I have found.
- ~~a cheatsheet explaining how to conjugate verbs into each different tense that I know of.~~
  - ~~incl: preterite, present, conditional (I know it exists, but I cannot translate as of yet), and pure future~~
- ~~a guide on how to structure sentences and form names in the Djhavi language.~~
- a guide on how to speak and transcribe the Djhavi language from my studies.
- and a quick introduction to the Djhavian language, explaining the history of the Djhavi people and other tidbits that I have learnt during my travels.

I wish you luck, fellow polyglot, in our mystical journey through this incredible language!
