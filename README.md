# Djhavi-Conlang
A simple glyphic conlang that I have recently began developing.

At current (07.06.24), the conlang is *very* basic, with only three tenses -- preterite (I did), present (I do), and pure future (I will do) -- and a limited vocabulary, however I am actively expanding its features

The final Djhavi repo will feature:
- a dictionary containing every known noun, adjective, infinitive verb, etc.
- a cheatsheet explaining how to conjugate verbs into each different tense
  - incl: preterite, present, conditional, and pure future
- a guide on how to structure sentences and form names in the Djhavi language
- a guide on how to speak and transcribe the Djhavi language
- and a quick introduction to the Djhavi language, explaining its origin and other tidbits, such as the tribes' beliefs, etc.
